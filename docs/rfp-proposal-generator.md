## 1. Basics — What Is the RFP Proposal Generator?

### 1.1 Overview

The RFP Proposal Generator is a **7-stage, human-in-the-loop AI workflow** built into the MARS platform. It transforms a raw RFP (Request for Proposal) document into a **complete, professional technical proposal** — from requirements analysis through architecture design to the final compiled document — while keeping the human in control at every step.

The feature is registered under the mode **`rfp-proposal`** and appears in the UI as **"RFP Proposal Generator"** on the Tasks page.

### 1.2 What It Produces

Starting from an RFP document, the system outputs:

| Artifact | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements Analysis | Markdown | Structured functional, non-functional, stakeholders, risks |
| Tools & Technology | Markdown | Complete tool selection with per-tool cost estimates and comparison tables |
| Cloud & Infrastructure | Markdown | Cloud architecture design with itemized cost breakdown and provider comparison |
| Implementation Plan | Markdown | Phased delivery roadmap with timeline, sprints, and budget |
| Architecture Design | Markdown | System architecture with component diagrams and ADRs |
| Execution Strategy | Markdown | Full execution strategy from kickoff to post-launch |
| **Compiled Proposal** | Markdown | **Final compiled proposal** with executive summary, pricing, and appendices |
| Cost Summary | Markdown | Per-stage token usage and USD cost breakdown |

### 1.3 Key Design Principles

| Principle | How It's Implemented |
|---|---|
| **Phase-Based Execution** | Each stage runs as an `RfpPhaseBase` subclass with a 3-agent pipeline: primary → specialist → reviewer (3+ LLM calls per stage) |
| **Multi-Agent Collaboration** | Each stage uses a team of 3 specialised agents with different models optimised for their role |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Users can review, edit, and refine AI output between every stage |
| **Progressive context** | Each stage builds on all previous stages (cumulative shared state) |
| **Real-time feedback** | WebSocket streaming + REST polling deliver live console output during execution |
| **Resumable** | Tasks persist in a database and can be resumed after page reloads or interruptions |
| **Auto-completing** | `WorkflowRun.status` transitions to `"completed"` automatically when all 7 stages finish |
| **Cost-transparent** | Per-LLM-call cost tracking is aggregated and displayed throughout the workflow |
| **Editable at every stage** | Resizable split-view editor (edit/preview + refinement chat) — both panes shrinkable to 200px min |
| **Token-safe** | Every LLM call has dynamic `max_completion_tokens` capping and automatic prompt chunking (0.75 safety margin) |
| **Dynamic currency** | Currency is extracted from the RFP (Stage 1) and propagated to all cost-producing stages; defaults to USD ($) |
| **Zero data loss** | Stage 7 uses a divide-and-accumulate strategy — no source data is ever truncated, condensed, or dropped |

### 1.4 Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, asyncio, OpenAI API |
| **Phase System** | `RfpPhaseBase` → 7 phase subclasses with generate→review cycles |
| **Frontend** | React, TypeScript, Next.js |
| **Real-time** | WebSocket + REST polling |
| **Database** | SQLite (via SQLAlchemy ORM) |
| **Default LLM** | Dynamic from `WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model` (configurable per agent role via `config_overrides`: `model`, `specialist_model`, `review_model`) |

### 1.5 Orchestration Model — Phase-Based (Generate → Review)

The RFP Proposal Generator uses the **Phase-Based** orchestration model with a custom `RfpPhaseBase` class hierarchy:

| Orchestration | Used By | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase-Based (RFP)** | **RFP Proposal Generator** | Each stage dynamically loads an `RfpPhaseBase` subclass via `_load_phase_class()`. The phase executes a generate → review cycle: 1 generation LLM call + 1 review LLM call per stage. Phase classes are in `cmbagent/phases/rfp/`. |
| **SwarmOrchestrator** | Copilot, Planning & Control (swarm) | Loads all agent classes into a unified swarm with dynamic routing. |
| **PhaseOrchestrator** | Deep Research, Planning & Control (classic) | Sequential phases from `PhaseRegistry`, each invoking agent classes. |

**Why Phase-Based for RFP:**

1. **Expert personas** — 7 phase classes each define a domain-specific system prompt (business analyst, cloud architect, etc.)
2. **3-agent pipeline** — Each phase makes 3 LLM calls (when `multi_agent=True`, the default): Primary (generate) → Specialist (validate & enrich) → Reviewer (13-point quality checklist). Set `multi_agent=False` for the original 2-call generate→review cycle.
3. **Cumulative context** — Each phase's `build_user_prompt()` injects all prior stages' output from shared state
4. **Human-in-the-loop** — Users review and edit between every stage via the split-view editor
5. **Quality enforcement** — The specialist and reviewer passes enforce consistent currency (dynamically detected from the RFP), cost table completeness, no placeholders, comparison tables, and security assessments

The `WorkflowRun` record stores `agent="phase_orchestrator"` and `meta.orchestration="phase-based"` to identify this execution model.

## 2. All Steps Used in the Workflow

The RFP Proposal Generator is an **8-step wizard** in the UI, mapping to **7 backend stages**:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WIZARD STEP 0        STEP 1         STEP 2       STEP 3      STEP 4           │
│  ─────────────     ───────────    ──────────    ──────────   ──────────         │
│  Setup Panel  ──►  Requirements ──► Tools ────► Cloud/Infra ──► Impl. Plan ──► │
│  (no stage)        (Stage 1)       (Stage 2)    (Stage 3)      (Stage 4)       │
│                                                                                  │
│  ... STEP 5       STEP 6       STEP 7                                           │

│  ──► Arch. ──► Execution ──► Proposal                                           │
│    (Stage 5)   (Stage 6)    (Stage 7)                                           │
│                                                                                  │
│  User enters     Phase class      User reviews/edits    Phase generates          │
│  RFP text +      generates →      with split-view       next section using       │
│  uploads docs    reviews output   editor + chat         all prior context        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 0 — Setup (No Backend Stage)

**UI Component:** `RfpSetupPanel.tsx`

| Action | Details |
|---|---|
| Upload RFP documents | Drag-and-drop zone at top; supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, JSON, and more — PDF text auto-populates the RFP textarea |
| Enter RFP content | Free-text area — paste the full RFP or describe project requirements (required) |
| Enter additional context | Organization info, budget range, preferences, constraints (optional) |
| Click "Analyze Requirements" | Triggers task creation + Stage 1 execution |

**On submit:** `POST /api/rfp/create` → creates `WorkflowRun` + 7 `TaskStage` records → auto-executes Stage 1

### Steps 1–6 — Stage Review & Editing

**UI Component:** `RfpReviewPanel.tsx` (reused per stage)

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Split view** | Resizable editor/preview + refinement chat via `ResizableSplitPane` (both panes shrinkable to 200px min) |
| **Auto-save** | Content saved to DB + disk after 1s debounce on edit |
| **AI refinement** | User types instruction → LLM refines content → user clicks "Apply" |
| **Next button** | Saves edits, then triggers next stage's phase execution |
| **Execution progress** | Real-time console output via WebSocket + timer + cost display |

### Step 7 — Proposal Compilation

**UI Component:** `RfpProposalPanel.tsx`

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| Success banner | "Proposal Generated Successfully" with checkmark |
| PDF preview | Resizable modal with embedded PDF viewer (`?inline=true`) |
| Proposal preview | Full rendered markdown of the compiled proposal |
| Download | Links for all 7 `.md` artifact files + PDF download |
| Cost summary | Total cost across all stages |

**Backend execution:** Uses the **divide-and-accumulate** strategy for zero data loss — see [Section 14](#14-divide-and-accumulate-strategy-stage-7).

             ├── Download links for all 7 artifacts
             └── Cost summary
```

### 3.5 Real-Time Monitoring

During stage execution, two parallel channels deliver updates:

| Channel | What It Delivers | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **REST Polling** | Console output lines (`GET /stages/{N}/console?since=X`) | Every 2 seconds |
| **WebSocket** | `stage_completed` / `stage_failed` events | Immediate |

Console output is captured via `_ConsoleCapture` — a thread-safe class that intercepts stdout/stderr and writes to both the server terminal and a shared in-memory buffer.

### 3.6 Task Resumption

Tasks are fully persistent and can be resumed:

1. `GET /api/rfp/recent` lists incomplete tasks (status="executing", progress < 100%)
2. User selects a task → `GET /api/rfp/{id}` loads full state
3. UI reconstructs the wizard position:
   - Running stage → reconnect WebSocket + resume console polling
   - Completed stage → show content in editor (editable)
   - Pending/failed stage → stop at that step (user can retry)

**In Progress layout:** When on Step 0, the RFP component fetches `GET /api/rfp/recent` on mount and displays in-progress task cards **above the setup panel** (inside the same page view). Each card shows the task name, current stage, progress bar, and resume/delete actions. The currently active task is filtered out of the list. When more than ~5 tasks are listed, the section becomes scrollable (max-height 320px with overflow-y auto) to prevent the setup panel from being pushed too far down. Both the in-progress cards and the setup form are always visible together — not a separate landing page.

### 3.7 Workflow Run Auto-Completion

When the final stage of an RFP task completes, `_run_rfp_stage()` automatically checks whether all `TaskStage` rows have `status == "completed"`. If so, it transitions the parent `WorkflowRun`:

- `status` → `"completed"`
- `completed_at` → current UTC timestamp

This prevents finished tasks from appearing in the `GET /api/rfp/recent` endpoint (which only returns `status="executing"` runs), ensuring the "In Progress" section accurately reflects only genuinely active work.

---

## 4. Outcomes — Saved and Processed

### 4.1 File System Layout

Every task gets a dedicated directory:

```
{session_id}/tasks/{task_id}/
│
├── input_files/
│   ├── rfp_input.md          ◄── Original RFP text (from Setup)
│   ├── rfp_context.md        ◄── Additional context (from Setup)
│   ├── *.pdf, *.docx, ...    ◄── User-uploaded RFP documents
│   ├── requirements.md       ◄── Stage 1 output (editable)
│   ├── tools.md              ◄── Stage 2 output (editable)
│   ├── cloud.md              ◄── Stage 3 output (editable)
│   ├── implementation.md     ◄── Stage 4 output (editable)
│   ├── architecture.md       ◄── Stage 5 output (editable)
│   ├── execution.md          ◄── Stage 6 output (editable)
│   ├── proposal.md           ◄── Stage 7 output (final compiled proposal)
│   └── cost_summary.md       ◄── Auto-generated cost breakdown (all stages)
```

### 4.2 Database Records

Each task creates:

| Model | Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Session** | 1 | Groups all records; supports suspend/resume (mode="rfp-proposal") |
| **WorkflowRun** | 1 | Parent task record (mode, status, work_dir, config, task_description) |
| **TaskStage** | 7 | One per stage (status, input_data, output_data, timing, error_message) |
| **CostRecord** | 7+ | One per stage execution (aggregated cost from all LLM calls within the stage: primary + specialist + reviewer) + any refinement calls |

### 4.3 Shared State — Cumulative Context

```
Stage 1 completes → shared_state = {
    requirements_analysis: "..."
}
Stage 2 completes → shared_state = {
    requirements_analysis: "...",
    tools_technology: "..."
}
...
Stage 7 → reads ALL 6 keys to compile final proposal
```

**Reconstruction:** Before each stage, `build_shared_state()` scans all completed prior stages and merges their `output_data["shared"]` dictionaries.

### 4.4 Output Processing Per Stage

| Stage | Phase Class | Output Key | File |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `RfpRequirementsPhase` | `requirements_analysis` | `requirements.md` |
| 2 | `RfpToolsPhase` | `tools_technology` | `tools.md` |
| 3 | `RfpCloudPhase` | `cloud_infrastructure` | `cloud.md` |
| 4 | `RfpImplementationPhase` | `implementation_plan` | `implementation.md` |
| 5 | `RfpArchitecturePhase` | `architecture_design` | `architecture.md` |
| 6 | `RfpExecutionPhase` | `execution_strategy` | `execution.md` |
| 7 | `RfpProposalPhase` | `proposal_compilation` | `proposal.md` |

### 4.5 Human Edits — Dual Persistence

When a user edits stage content, edits are saved in **two places** simultaneously:

1. **Database:** `output_data["shared"][key]` is updated in the `TaskStage` record
2. **Filesystem:** The corresponding `.md` file is overwritten

This ensures the next stage reads the human-edited version and task resumption restores the latest content.

### 4.6 Stage Definition Mapping

```python
STAGE_DEFS = [
    {"number": 1, "name": "requirements_analysis",  "shared_key": "requirements_analysis",  "file": "requirements.md"},
    {"number": 2, "name": "tools_technology",        "shared_key": "tools_technology",       "file": "tools.md"},
    {"number": 3, "name": "cloud_infrastructure",    "shared_key": "cloud_infrastructure",   "file": "cloud.md"},
    {"number": 4, "name": "implementation_plan",     "shared_key": "implementation_plan",    "file": "implementation.md"},
    {"number": 5, "name": "architecture_design",     "shared_key": "architecture_design",    "file": "architecture.md"},
    {"number": 6, "name": "execution_strategy",      "shared_key": "execution_strategy",     "file": "execution.md"},
    {"number": 7, "name": "proposal_compilation",    "shared_key": "proposal_compilation",   "file": "proposal.md"},
]
```

## 5. AI Techniques Used

### 5.1 Phase-Based Generate → Specialist → Review Cycle

Each of the 7 stages uses a dedicated `RfpPhaseBase` subclass that runs a **three-pass execution model** (when `multi_agent=True`, the default):

**Pass 1 — Generation:** The phase's `system_prompt` defines an expert AI persona. The `build_user_prompt(context)` method constructs the full prompt including RFP content, uploaded file context, and all prior stages' output from `shared_state`.

**Pass 2 — Specialist Validation:** A dedicated specialist agent (defined via `specialist_system_prompt`) validates, enriches, and adds domain-specific depth to the draft. Each stage has a unique specialist role (e.g., Security & Compliance Auditor for Stage 2, Cloud Cost Optimisation Specialist for Stage 3). The specialist output must exceed 30% of the original length to be accepted.

**Pass 3 — Review:** A shared `review_system_prompt` (defined in `RfpPhaseBase`) acts as a senior proposal reviewer with a **13-point quality checklist**. The reviewer receives the specialist-improved draft and polishes it to professional submission quality.

> **Note:** Set `multi_agent=False` to revert to the original 2-pass (generate → review) cycle, skipping the specialist pass.

```
Generation prompt structure:
  system: "You are a [domain expert persona]..."
  user:   phase.build_user_prompt(context)
          → includes RFP text, uploaded files, all prior stage outputs

Specialist prompt structure:
  system: "You are a [specialist role]..."
  user:   "Document to validate and improve:\n\n{draft}" + currency_rule

Review prompt structure:
  system: "You are a senior proposal reviewer...  Specifically:
           1. Fix factual errors...
           2. Ensure all cost figures...
           ...13 checklist items..."
  user:   "Draft document:\n\n{specialist_improved_content}"
```

### 5.2 Cumulative Context Injection

Each phase's `build_user_prompt()` reads from `context.shared_state`, which grows with each completed stage:

```
Stage 1: RFP content + uploaded docs
Stage 2: requirements_analysis (from Stage 1)
Stage 3: requirements_analysis + tools_technology (Stages 1–2)
Stage 4: requirements + tools + cloud (Stages 1–3)
Stage 5: requirements + tools + cloud + implementation (Stages 1–4)
Stage 6: all 5 prior stages
Stage 7: ALL 6 prior stages (full proposal context)
```

### 5.3 Role-Based Expert Personas

Each phase class defines a specialized system prompt optimized for that stage:

| Stage | Phase Class | AI Persona | Expertise |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `RfpRequirementsPhase` | Expert Business Analyst (15+ years) | Requirements extraction, risk identification, stakeholder mapping, budget analysis |
| 2 | `RfpToolsPhase` | Senior Solutions Architect (20+ years) | Technology evaluation, head-to-head comparisons, licensing analysis, security assessment |
| 3 | `RfpCloudPhase` | Cloud Infrastructure Architect (20+ years, public + government cloud) | RFP hosting mandate compliance, provider comparison, IaC, cost optimization, managed services |
| 4 | `RfpImplementationPhase` | Senior Project Manager & Delivery Lead | Timeline planning, sprint structure, resource allocation, quality gates |
| 5 | `RfpArchitecturePhase` | Principal System Architect | System design, component boundaries, data architecture, ADRs |
| 6 | `RfpExecutionPhase` | Delivery Executive & Program Manager | Go-live planning, CI/CD, testing strategy, governance, KPIs |

### 5.4 Review System Prompt — 13-Point Quality Checklist

The shared review prompt (inherited from `RfpPhaseBase`) enforces:

1. Fix factual errors, strengthen weak sections, add missing detail
2. Improve structure and flow, ensure proper section numbering
3. Ensure ALL cost figures are present, consistent, and fit within budget
4. Verify every tool/technology has a comparison table vs alternatives
5. Verify security features are compared for each major tool and service
6. Verify hosting platform compliance and any provider comparison is thorough
7. Add professional tables where data is listed as bullets
8. Replace ANY placeholder text (`[Insert ...]`, `[To be added]`) with ACTUAL content
9. Ensure ALL monetary values use a single consistent currency throughout (dynamically detected from the RFP; defaults to USD if not found) — no mixed currencies
10. Verify every cost table has Monthly and Annual columns with actual dollar figures
11. Verify Annual Cost = Monthly Cost × 12 (fix math errors)
12. Verify appendices contain REAL content (full tables, glossary entries, references)
13. Ensure the document reads as a polished enterprise proposal — not an AI summary

### 5.5 Human-in-the-Loop Refinement

Between every stage, users can:
- **Direct edit** — Modify the generated markdown in the split-view editor
- **AI refinement** — Give natural language instructions to improve content

The refinement uses a **separate LLM call** with a dedicated system prompt and full **token safety protection**:

```
System: "You are a technical proposal consultant. Refine the following content
         based on the user's instruction. Return ONLY the refined markdown
         content, no explanations."
User:   "Current content:\n\n{content}\n\n---\n\nInstruction: {user_message}"
```

Model: dynamic from `WorkflowConfig`, Temperature: `0.7`, Max completion tokens: dynamically capped

**Token safety:** The refine endpoint checks token capacity before calling the LLM. If the content exceeds the usable context window, it is **trimmed** by taking the start and end of the content (preserving context from both halves) using tiktoken token-level encoding/decoding. The OpenAI client uses `timeout=300` to prevent connection resets on large content.

### 5.6 File Context Augmentation

Uploaded RFP documents are scanned by `_build_rfp_context()` and their content is injected into the prompt:

| File Type | Extraction Method |
|---|---|
| `.pdf` | Rich extraction via `pdf_extractor.py` — text, tables (markdown), image descriptions (up to 512KB) |
| `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html` | Full content preview (first 4KB) |
| Other files | Metadata only (name, size, path) |

Braces in extracted content are escaped (`{` → `{{`) to prevent `str.format()` interpretation.

### 5.7 Prompt Engineering Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Used In |
|---|---|---|
| **Persona prompting** | "You are a [role]" — each phase has a domain expert persona | All 7 phase `system_prompt` properties |
| **Generate → review** | Draft generation followed by specialist validation then quality review pass | `RfpPhaseBase.execute()` |
| **Multi-agent teams** | 3-agent pipeline (Primary → Specialist → Reviewer) using different models per role | `agent_teams.py`, `_run_specialist()` |
| **Structured output** | Explicit section headings, numbered requirements, table formats | All 7 phase `build_user_prompt()` methods |
| **Cumulative context** | Prior stages' output injected as reference material | `build_user_prompt()` reads `context.shared_state` |
| **Constraint enforcement** | Dynamic currency from RFP, no placeholders, comparison tables required | `review_system_prompt` 13-point checklist, `get_currency_rule()` |
| **Token capacity management** | Automatic prompt chunking and dynamic `max_completion_tokens` capping at every LLM call | `token_utils.py`, `RfpPhaseBase.execute()` |
| **Divide-and-accumulate** | Zero-data-loss source grouping and merging for Stage 7 | `RfpProposalPhase.execute()`, `group_sources_by_budget()` |
| **Budget awareness** | Stage 1 extracts budget; downstream stages must respect it | Stages 2, 3, 4 prompts reference budget from requirements |

## 6. Architecture Deep Dive

### 6.1 Phase Class Hierarchy

```
Phase (cmbagent/phases/base.py)                    # Abstract base
  └── RfpPhaseBase (cmbagent/phases/rfp/base.py)   # Generate→review engine
        ├── RfpRequirementsPhase                    # Stage 1
        ├── RfpToolsPhase                           # Stage 2
        ├── RfpCloudPhase                           # Stage 3
        ├── RfpImplementationPhase                  # Stage 4
        ├── RfpArchitecturePhase                    # Stage 5
        ├── RfpExecutionPhase                       # Stage 6
        └── RfpProposalPhase                        # Stage 7
```

Each subclass provides:
- `phase_type` — Identifier (e.g., `"rfp_requirements"`)
- `display_name` — Human-readable label
- `shared_output_key` — Key in shared_state dict
- `output_filename` — File to write output to
- `system_prompt` — Expert persona (generation pass)
- `build_user_prompt(context)` — Full prompt construction

### 6.2 RfpPhaseConfig

```python
@dataclass
class RfpPhaseConfig(PhaseConfig):
    model: str = field(default_factory=_default_model)  # resolved from WorkflowConfig
    temperature: float = 0.7
    max_completion_tokens: int = 16384
    n_reviews: int = 1              # 0 = single-shot, 1+ = generate → review
    review_model: Optional[str] = None  # defaults to same as model; overridable via UI or config_overrides
    multi_agent: bool = True        # enable 3-agent pipeline (primary → specialist → reviewer)
    specialist_model: Optional[str] = None  # defaults from agent_teams; overridable via UI or config_overrides
```

> **Note:** `_default_model()` resolves the model dynamically from `WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model` at runtime. No model name is hardcoded — changing the config changes all stages.

> **Note:** The `temperature` parameter is automatically omitted for reasoning models (o3-mini, o1-*) that do not support it.

### 6.3 Dynamic Phase Loading

Phases are loaded via `importlib` to avoid circular imports:

```python
_PHASE_CLASSES = {
    1: "cmbagent.phases.rfp.requirements_phase:RfpRequirementsPhase",
    2: "cmbagent.phases.rfp.tools_phase:RfpToolsPhase",
    3: "cmbagent.phases.rfp.cloud_phase:RfpCloudPhase",
    4: "cmbagent.phases.rfp.implementation_phase:RfpImplementationPhase",
    5: "cmbagent.phases.rfp.architecture_phase:RfpArchitecturePhase",
    6: "cmbagent.phases.rfp.execution_phase:RfpExecutionPhase",
    7: "cmbagent.phases.rfp.proposal_phase:RfpProposalPhase",
}

def _load_phase_class(stage_num):
    import importlib
    ref = _PHASE_CLASSES[stage_num]
    module_path, cls_name = ref.rsplit(":", 1)
    mod = importlib.import_module(module_path)
    return getattr(mod, cls_name)
```

### 6.4 Console Capture

`_ConsoleCapture` is a thread-safe stdout/stderr interceptor:

```
_ConsoleCapture (per stage)
    │
    ├── write(text) → original stdout (server logs)
    │              → _console_buffers["{task_id}:{stage_num}"] (shared buffer)
    │
    └── Exposed via:
         ├── REST: GET /api/rfp/{id}/stages/{N}/console?since=X
         └── WebSocket: /ws/rfp/{id}/{N} → polls buffer every 1s
```

## 8. Configuration & Model Defaults

### 8.1 UI Model Settings

The RFP setup panel includes an optional **Model Settings** toggle (gear icon) that allows users to override the default LLM model for each agent role before starting the proposal. This uses the centralized `useModelConfig` hook which fetches available models from `/api/models/config` (falls back to a static list if the API is unavailable).

**Component:** `RfpStageAdvancedSettings.tsx` in `mars-ui/components/rfp/`

Three separate dropdowns allow independent model selection per agent role:

- **Primary Agent Model** → stored in `taskConfig.model` → `config_overrides.model`
- **Specialist Agent Model** → stored in `taskConfig.specialist_model` → `config_overrides.specialist_model`
- **Reviewer Agent Model** → stored in `taskConfig.review_model` → `config_overrides.review_model`

If a user leaves any dropdown unselected, the default model from `WorkflowConfig` is used for that role.

**Model Selection Flow — UI to Backend:**

1. **UI:** `RfpSetupPanel` renders `RfpStageAdvancedSettings` with 3 dropdowns (Primary, Specialist, Reviewer) populated by `useModelConfig()`.
2. **Hook:** `useRfpTask.executeStage()` reads `taskConfig.model`, `taskConfig.specialist_model`, `taskConfig.review_model` and sets the corresponding `config_overrides` fields. `taskConfig` is correctly listed in the `useCallback` dependency array, so model changes are always reflected.
3. **API:** `POST /api/rfp/{id}/stages/{N}/execute` accepts `{ config_overrides }`.
4. **Backend:** `_run_rfp_stage()` extracts `model`, `specialist_model`, `review_model` from `config_overrides`, applies them to the phase config.
5. **Phase execution:** The phase is instantiated with `RfpPhaseConfig(model=model, n_reviews=n_reviews, specialist_model=specialist_model, review_model=review_model)`.

### 8.2 Phase Model Defaults (RfpPhaseConfig)

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | Dynamic (`_default_model()`) | Resolved from `WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model` at runtime; overridable via `config_overrides.model` (Primary Agent) |
| `temperature` | `0.7` | Balances creativity and coherence (omitted for reasoning models) |
| `max_completion_tokens` | `16,384` | Large enough for detailed sections |
| `n_reviews` | `1` | 1 review pass per stage |
| `review_model` | `None` (same as model) | Reviewer agent model; overridable via `config_overrides.review_model` or UI dropdown |
| `multi_agent` | `True` | Enable 3-agent pipeline (primary → specialist → reviewer). Set `False` for 2-pass generate→review. |
| `specialist_model` | `None` (per-stage) | Specialist agent model; overridable via `config_overrides.specialist_model` or UI dropdown |

### 8.3 Dynamic Model Resolution

All stages resolve their model dynamically from `WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model` — **no model names are hardcoded**.

The resolution chain:
1. `_get_default_rfp_model()` in `backend/routers/rfp.py` reads from `WorkflowConfig`
2. `_default_model()` in `base.py` reads from `WorkflowConfig` (used by `RfpPhaseConfig.model`)
3. `_cfg_model()` in `agent_teams.py` reads from `WorkflowConfig` (used by `get_phase_models()`)
4. `_default_model()` in `token_utils.py` reads from `WorkflowConfig` (used by `count_tokens()` default)

Model resolution priority (per agent role):
1. **Explicit user selection** (via UI / `config_overrides`) — highest priority
2. **`agent_teams.py` defaults** — fallback from `get_phase_models()`
3. **`WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model`** — base default

> **Azure deployment:** Ensure `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` is set to your deployment name.
> Set `CMBAGENT_DEFAULT_MODEL` environment variable or update `WorkflowConfig` to change the base default for all agents.

### 8.4 Model Override

Override models per agent role via `config_overrides` in the execute request:

```json
{
  "config_overrides": {
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "specialist_model": "gpt-4.1-mini",
    "review_model": "gpt-4o",
    "n_reviews": 1
  }
}
```

### 8.5 Available Models (11 entries, 10 unique)

| Model | Best For |
|---|---|
| `gpt-4o` | Good balance of speed, quality, and availability (**duplicated** in frontend dropdown) |
| `gpt-5.3` | Best reasoning and largest output window |
| `gpt-4.1` | Strong analytical and writing quality |
| `gpt-4.1-mini` | Cost-effective with 1M context window |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | Faster and cheaper — good for iteration |
| `o3-mini` | Reasoning-focused tasks (does not support `temperature`) |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | Strong long-context reasoning (requires Gemini API key) |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Cost-effective for long outputs (requires Gemini API key) |
| `claude-sonnet-4` | High-quality alternative (requires Anthropic API key) |
| `claude-3.5-sonnet` | Alternative provider (requires Anthropic API key) |

> **Note:** The default model is resolved from `WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model`. All models in this table are supported and can be set globally or per-stage.

### 8.6 Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Required? | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | **Yes** | All 7 stages (generation + review) + refinement |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional | If using Anthropic models via override |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Optional | If using Gemini models via override |

### 8.7 Server Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| **Backend Port** | `8000` |
| **Frontend Port** | `3000` |
| **API Docs** | `http://localhost:8000/docs` |
| **WebSocket** | `ws://localhost:8000/ws/rfp/{id}/{N}` |

### 8.8 Supported Upload File Types

`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`

## 9. Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### 9.1 Common Errors

#### All Stages

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Stage {N} ({name}) must be completed first` | Previous stages incomplete | Complete all prior stages |
| `Stage is already running` | Duplicate execution request | Wait for current execution |
| `Task not found` | Invalid task_id | Check task_id from `/api/rfp/recent` |

#### Stage 1 — Requirements Analysis

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Empty output | Model returned empty response | Retry; verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` validity |
| Very short analysis | Insufficient RFP input | Provide more detailed RFP content |

#### Stage 7 — Proposal Compilation

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Incomplete sections | Model context window exceeded | Use a model with larger context window |
| Missing cost tables | Prior stages' tools/cloud data was thin | Edit Stages 2–3 to add more cost detail before re-running Stage 7 |

### 9.2 Diagnostics

**Check stage error:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rfp/{task_id}/stages/{stage_num}/content
```

**Check full task status:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rfp/{task_id}
```

**Check via database:**
```sql
SELECT stage_number, status, error_message FROM task_stages
WHERE parent_run_id = '{task_id}' ORDER BY stage_number;
```

### 9.3 Retry Behavior

- Failed stages show error + **Retry** button in the UI
- Retries re-run the phase from scratch (generate → review)
- Previous stages' outputs are preserved in shared_state
- Console buffers are reset on retry

| **Split-View Editor** | Resizable editor/preview + refinement chat layout via `ResizableSplitPane` (both panes shrinkable to 200px min) |
| **Token capacity management** | System that prevents context window overflow at every LLM call via dynamic capping, prompt chunking, and 0.75 safety margin |
| **Safety margin (0.75)** | Fraction of model context window used for budget calculation — accounts for tiktoken undercounting by 10–20% |
| **Dynamic currency** | Currency code and symbol extracted from the RFP at Stage 1, propagated to all cost-producing stages |
| **Divide-and-accumulate** | Stage 7 strategy: divide sources into groups → generate partial proposals → merge with accumulation pass (zero data loss) |
| **`group_sources_by_budget`** | Greedy bin-packing of source sections into groups that fit the model's context window |
| **`chunk_prompt_if_needed`** | Splits oversized prompts at `---` section boundaries into sub-prompts that fit the context window |

### 11.5 LLM Call Sites

There are **11 protected LLM call sites** in the RFP workflow (with `multi_agent=True`). Every call has dynamic `max_completion_tokens` capping and automatic prompt chunking with a 0.75 safety margin:

| # | Call Site | Location | Purpose | Token Protection |
|---|-----------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Generation (single)** | `RfpPhaseBase.execute()` | Primary agent generates stage content | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 2 | **Generation (chunked)** | `RfpPhaseBase.execute()` | Primary agent when prompt exceeds context | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 3 | **Specialist (single)** | `RfpPhaseBase._run_specialist()` | Specialist agent validates & enriches | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 4 | **Specialist (chunked)** | `RfpPhaseBase._run_specialist()` | Specialist agent when content exceeds context | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 5 | **Review (single)** | `RfpPhaseBase.execute()` | Reviewer agent 13-point checklist | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 6 | **Review (chunked)** | `RfpPhaseBase.execute()` | Reviewer when draft exceeds context | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 7 | **Stage 7 generation** | `RfpProposalPhase._single_generate()` | Single/partial/accumulation calls | Dynamic cap via `get_model_limits` |
| 8 | **Stage 7 specialist** | `RfpProposalPhase.execute()` | Specialist validates compiled proposal | `_run_specialist()` (inherited) |
| 9 | **Stage 7 review (single)** | `RfpProposalPhase.execute()` | Review compiled proposal | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 10 | **Stage 7 review (chunked)** | `RfpProposalPhase.execute()` | Chunked review of large proposal | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 11 | **Refinement chat** | `refine_rfp_content()` in `rfp.py` | User-requested content improvement | Dynamic cap + content trimming |

All LLM calls use: `temperature=0.7`, `max_completion_tokens=dynamically capped` (default ceiling: `16384`).
Models are assigned dynamically from `WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model` via `get_phase_models()` when `multi_agent=True` (see [Section 15.2](#152-model-assignments)).

## 12. Token Capacity Management

Source: `cmbagent/phases/rfp/token_utils.py`, `cmbagent/phases/rfp/base.py`, `cmbagent/phases/rfp/proposal_phase.py`, `backend/routers/rfp.py`

### 12.1 Overview

Every LLM call in the RFP pipeline is protected against context window overflow. There are **11 distinct LLM call sites** (with `multi_agent=True`), each with:
- **Dynamic `max_completion_tokens` capping** — prompt + output never exceeds context
- **Automatic prompt chunking** — oversized prompts are split at `---` section boundaries
- **0.75 safety margin** — tiktoken undercounts by 10–20% vs the API's actual tokenizer

### 12.2 Safety Margin

All token budget calculations use:

```python
usable_ctx = int(max_ctx * 0.75) - max_completion_tokens
```

The 0.75 margin (instead of 0.90) accounts for tiktoken's undercounting of special tokens, markdown formatting characters, and Unicode content.

### 12.3 Dynamic `max_completion_tokens` Capping

At every LLM call:

```python
prompt_tokens = count_tokens(system + user, model)
available_for_output = max_ctx - prompt_tokens - 200  # safety buffer
max_comp = min(config.max_completion_tokens, max(available_for_output, 4096))
```

This prevents `finish_reason=length` truncation by ensuring the model has room for output.

### 12.4 Prompt Chunking

When a prompt exceeds the usable context window:
1. The user prompt is split at `---` section boundaries
2. Each chunk is sent as a separate API call with context about which part it is
3. Results are concatenated

If no `---` boundaries exist, the prompt is returned as a single-element list so the caller processes it through the chunked code path (with logging) rather than silently sending an oversized request.

### 12.5 Protected Call Sites

All **11 LLM call sites** (with `multi_agent=True`) in the RFP pipeline are protected:

| # | Call Site | File | Protection |
|---|-----------|------|------------|
| 1 | Generation (single-shot) | `base.py` | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 2 | Generation (chunked) | `base.py` | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 3 | Specialist (single-shot) | `base.py` | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 4 | Specialist (chunked) | `base.py` | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 5 | Review (single-shot) | `base.py` | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 6 | Review (chunked) | `base.py` | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 7 | Stage 7 `_single_generate` | `proposal_phase.py` | Dynamic cap via `get_model_limits` |
| 8 | Stage 7 specialist | `proposal_phase.py` | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 9 | Stage 7 review (single) | `proposal_phase.py` | `chunk_prompt_if_needed` + dynamic cap |
| 10 | Stage 7 review (chunked) | `proposal_phase.py` | Per-chunk dynamic cap |
| 11 | Refinement chat | `rfp.py` | Dynamic cap + content trimming (start+end) |

### 12.6 Key Functions (`token_utils.py`)

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `get_model_limits(model)` | Returns `(max_context, max_output)` for a model |
| `count_tokens(text, model)` | Count tokens using tiktoken (fallback: chars÷4) |
| `count_messages_tokens(messages, model)` | Count tokens for a chat message list |
| `chunk_prompt_if_needed(system, user, model, max_completion, safety_margin)` | Returns `None` (fits) or `List[str]` (chunks) |
| `group_sources_by_budget(sources, base_tokens, model, max_completion, safety_margin)` | Group source keys into batches that fit context window |

### 12.7 Model Token Limits Registry

| Model | Max Context | Max Output |
|-------|------------|------------|
| `gpt-4o` | 128,000 | 16,384 |
| `gpt-4o-mini` | 128,000 | 16,384 |
| `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` | 128,000 | 16,384 |
| `gpt-4.1` / `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` | 1,000,000 | 32,768 |
| `gpt-4.1-mini` | 1,000,000 | 32,768 |
| `gpt-5.3` | 1,000,000 | 32,768 |
| `o3-mini` / `o3-mini-2025-01-31` | 128,000 | 16,384 |
| `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | 200,000 | 8,192 |
| `claude-3.5-sonnet-20241022` | 200,000 | 8,192 |
| `gemini-2.5-pro` | 1,000,000 | 8,192 |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | 1,000,000 | 8,192 |

Unknown models fall back to 128K context / 16K output.

## 13. Dynamic Currency System

Source: `cmbagent/phases/rfp/requirements_phase.py` (extraction), `cmbagent/phases/rfp/base.py` (rule generation + automatic injection)

### 13.1 Currency Extraction (Stage 1)

The requirements phase prompt includes:

```
10. **Currency** — Identify the currency used in the RFP (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, INR, AUD, CAD).
    Look for currency symbols ($, €, £, ₹), currency codes, or country context.
    Search the ENTIRE RFP including payment terms, billing clauses, and annexures.
    Output:
    ## Currency
    **Primary Currency:** <CODE> (<SYMBOL>)
    If no currency is explicitly stated, default to USD ($).
```

### 13.2 Currency Rule Generation (`get_currency_rule`) — 3-Pass Detection

`RfpPhaseBase.get_currency_rule(context)` uses a robust **3-pass detection** system:

```
Pass 1: Scan requirements analysis for structured output
  - Pattern A: **Primary Currency:** INR (₹)
  - Pattern B: looser — "Currency: INR" or "Payment — INR"

Pass 2: Scan original RFP text for explicit currency mentions
  - Currency names: "Indian Rupees", "British Pounds", etc.
  - ISO codes: INR, EUR, GBP, AUD, etc.
  - Currency symbols: ₹, €, £

Pass 3: Fallback to USD ($) only if no signal found in Pass 1 or 2
```

Supported currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, INR, AUD, CAD, JPY, CNY, SGD, AED, SAR, CHF.

### 13.3 Automatic Currency Injection (Base Class Level)

The currency rule is **automatically injected** by `RfpPhaseBase` at 3 points — no individual phase can miss it:

| Agent | Injection Point | Code Location |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **Primary Agent** | Appended to `build_user_prompt()` output | `execute()` in `base.py` |
| **Specialist Agent** | Appended to specialist validation prompt | `_run_specialist()` in `base.py` |
| **Reviewer Agent** | Appended to review prompt | Review loop in `execute()` |

This means **all 7 stages × all 3 agents** (21 LLM calls) enforce the correct currency.

Additionally, individual phases (Tools, Cloud, Implementation, Proposal) include the currency rule explicitly in their `build_user_prompt()` — this is redundant but harmless (the rule is simply reinforced).

The review system prompt also uses generic "single consistent currency" language (item 9) so it validates any detected currency.

---

## 14. Divide-and-Accumulate Strategy (Stage 7)

Source: `cmbagent/phases/rfp/proposal_phase.py`

### 14.1 Problem

Stage 7 injects all 6 prior stage outputs into one prompt. For GPT-4o (128K context), this frequently exceeds the context window. Truncation or condensation would lose critical cost figures, comparison tables, and timelines.

### 14.2 Solution: Zero-Data-Loss

`RfpProposalPhase` overrides `execute()` with a custom strategy:

**PATH A (prompt fits):**
1. Build full prompt with all 6 sources
2. Single generation call with dynamic `max_completion_tokens` cap
3. If API returns empty/short output (tiktoken undercount) → automatically fall back to PATH B

**PATH B (prompt overflows or PATH A failed):**
1. `group_sources_by_budget()` — greedy bin-packing of sources into groups that each fit the context window
2. For each group: `_build_partial_prompt()` targeting only that group's assigned proposal sections → `_single_generate()` with dynamic cap
3. Accumulation pass: LLM merges all partial outputs into one cohesive document (preserves 100% of content, fixes numbering, removes duplicates)
4. If accumulation prompt itself overflows → direct concatenation (still zero data loss)

**Specialist pass** (when `multi_agent=True`):
- Runs after PATH A/B content generation, before review
- Uses `_run_specialist()` inherited from `RfpPhaseBase`
- Full token safety: `chunk_prompt_if_needed(safety_margin=0.75)` + dynamic cap
- Accepted if enriched output > 30% of original length

**Review pass:**
- Uses `chunk_prompt_if_needed(safety_margin=0.75)` on the compiled proposal
- Single-shot or chunked review with dynamic `max_completion_tokens` cap at every call
- Only accepted if review output > 50% of draft length

### 14.3 Source-to-Section Mapping

| Source | Assigned Proposal Sections |
|--------|---------------------------|
| `requirements_analysis` | Cover Page, Executive Summary, Purpose & Introduction, Understanding of Requirements |
| `tools_technology` | Technology Stack & Tooling, Appendix B (Evaluation Matrices) |
| `cloud_infrastructure` | Cloud Infrastructure & Provider Selection, Appendix A (Cost Breakdowns) |
| `implementation_plan` | Methodology, Timeline & Milestones, Resources, Implementation Approach |
| `architecture_design` | Proposed Solution Overview, System Architecture, Appendix C (Charts & Data) |
| `execution_strategy` | Execution Plan, Risk Management, Qualifications, Compliance, Pricing, Terms, Appendices D & E |

### 14.4 Key Helper (`_single_generate`)

All generation calls in Stage 7 go through `_single_generate()` which:
1. Calculates prompt tokens via `count_tokens()`
2. Dynamically caps `max_completion_tokens` to stay within context
3. Stores `_last_usage` and `_last_finish_reason` for diagnostics

---

## 15. Multi-Agent System

Source: `cmbagent/phases/rfp/agent_teams.py`, `cmbagent/phases/rfp/base.py`

### 15.1 Overview

Each RFP stage uses a **team of 3 specialised agents** that collaborate sequentially:

```
Primary Agent → Specialist Agent → Reviewer Agent
  (generate)       (validate)        (quality check)
```

- **Primary Agent** — Domain expert that generates the initial content (same persona as the stage's `system_prompt`)
- **Specialist Agent** — Secondary expert that validates, enriches, and adds domain-specific depth using a dedicated `specialist_system_prompt`
- **Reviewer Agent** — Quality reviewer with 13-point checklist (existing `review_system_prompt`)

### 15.2 Model Assignments

Users can select **independent models for each agent role** via the Advanced Settings panel (3 dropdowns: Primary Agent Model, Specialist Agent Model, Reviewer Agent Model). If not explicitly selected, all roles default to `WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model`.

Model resolution priority per agent role:
1. **Explicit user selection** (via UI / `config_overrides`) — highest priority
2. **`agent_teams.py` defaults** — fallback from `get_phase_models()`
3. **`WorkflowConfig.default_llm_model`** — base default

| Stage | Primary Model | Specialist Model | Reviewer Model |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 — Requirements | `config.model` | `config.specialist_model` or default | `config.review_model` or default |
| 2 — Tools & Technology | `config.model` | `config.specialist_model` or default | `config.review_model` or default |
| 3 — Cloud Infrastructure | `config.model` | `config.specialist_model` or default | `config.review_model` or default |
| 4 — Implementation | `config.model` | `config.specialist_model` or default | `config.review_model` or default |
| 5 — Architecture Design | `config.model` | `config.specialist_model` or default | `config.review_model` or default |
| 6 — Execution Strategy | `config.model` | `config.specialist_model` or default | `config.review_model` or default |
| 7 — Proposal Compilation | `config.model` | `config.specialist_model` or default | `config.review_model` or default |

### 15.3 Specialist Roles Per Stage

| Stage | Specialist Role | Key Validation Focus |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | Domain Validation Expert | Implicit requirements, stakeholder gaps, hidden costs, currency |
| 2 | Security & Compliance Auditor | CVE accuracy, license compliance, supply chain risks |
| 3 | Cloud Cost Optimisation Specialist | Pricing accuracy, reserved vs on-demand, FinOps |
| 4 | Delivery Assurance Analyst | Timeline feasibility, resource bottlenecks, sprint velocity |
| 5 | Scalability & Implementation Engineer | Component boundaries, performance bottlenecks, ADR quality |
| 6 | Risk & Governance Specialist | Go-live strategy, risk register, RACI, KPIs |
| 7 | Senior Proposal Editor | Document flow, cost table math, placeholder detection |

### 15.4 Execution Flow

```

```

### 15.5 Configuration

```python
RfpPhaseConfig(
    multi_agent=True,          # Enable 3-agent pipeline (default: True)
    specialist_model=None,     # Override specialist model (default: per-stage)
    # ... existing fields ...
)
```

Set `multi_agent=False` to revert to the original 2-pass (generate → review) behaviour.

### 15.6 Token Safety

The specialist pass has the same full token protection as all other LLM calls:

1. `chunk_prompt_if_needed(safety_margin=0.75)` — split if prompt exceeds usable context
2. Dynamic `max_completion_tokens` capping — `min(config.max_completion_tokens, max(available, 4096))`
3. Chunked specialist — each chunk independently capped
4. Content validation — enriched output must exceed 30% of original to be accepted

### 15.7 Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent_teams.py` | `_build_phase_models()` function, `get_phase_models()` helper |
| `base.py` | `RfpPhaseConfig.multi_agent`, `specialist_system_prompt` property, `_run_specialist()` method |
| `*_phase.py` (all 7) | Each defines a `specialist_system_prompt` property with domain-specific instructions |
